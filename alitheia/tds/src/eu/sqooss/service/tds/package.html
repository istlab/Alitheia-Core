The TDS (Thin Data Service) is a service within the Alitheia
system that performs basic data access. It has no intelligence,
and returns raw data retrieved from the File System or other
storage mechanism only. The TDS should be wrapped up and
coddled by the FDS (Fat Data Service) for intelligent use.

The TDS hands out accessors to the kinds of raw data it has.
Access is initially granted through a project accessor of
type TDAccessor; this is tied to a specific project (by
project ID, although an informative name may be attached to
it as well). The TDAccessor can be used to obtain accessors
for specific kinds of raw data. The three types currently
supported are:

    - SCMAccessor, via getSCMAccessor(), for SVN data
    - MailAccessor, via getMailAccessor(), for mail data
    - BTSAccessor, via getBTSAccessor(), for bug data

Typical workflow will therefore be:

    - Obtain reference to TDS
    - Obtain TDAccessor from TDS
    - Obtain raw data accessor from TDAccessor
    - Use the raw data accessor

Note that a TDAccessor must be released back to the TDS at
some point, for resource management (it may be impossible to
create too many accessors for different projects). TDAccessor
objects may be shared between different threads or metrics
wanting access to the same raw data (although really, they should
be going through the FDS most of the time).
