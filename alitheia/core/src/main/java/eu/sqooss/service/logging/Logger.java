/**
 * The <code>Logger</code> instances are used for logging. They are created
 * with createLogger method of the LogManager service. Loggers are given
 * log messages through a number of methods; the method names indicate
 * the severity of the message.
 *
 * The logging methods match those of the log4j Logger class. See the
 * documentation of log4j for more information.
 *
 * @section Using log levels
 *
 * The suggested use of the log levels -- in order to provide a useful
 * semantic basis for interpreting the logs of an Alitheia system when
 * troubleshooting -- is as follows:
 *
 *   - debug is used to log entering or exiting a method; small algorithmic
 *           steps within a method. It should probably be used only in the
 *           development phase.
 *   - info logs actions and largers algorithmic steps; log the sucessful
 *          completion of an action as info. The flow of info log statements
 *          should give an indication of what is happening in the application.
 *          With info messages, the high-level picture of what the system is doing
 *          should be clear.
 *   - warn is used to indicate that something recoverable is wrong. Typically
 *          used when configuration values are unusual or resources are not
 *          available. Warnings should indicate the nature of the problem
 *          and, if possible, how it may be resolved.
 *   - error indicates non-recoverable problems or program logic errors.
 *           Use error to log to the console that bad parameters have been
 *           passed in (perhaps before throwing an exception).
 *
 * The constants used here are the legal names for loggers; any others
 * will cause an exception to be thrown when used.
