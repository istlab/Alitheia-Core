This is the Maven project tree for the Alitheia system, its components and
metrics. The top-level tree is split into the following groups:

alitheia/
    Contains the source code and build definitions for the Alitheia core and
    its components.

metrics/
    Contain the source code of the various metric plug-ins developed for the
    Alitheia system.

webui/
    Contains the source code and build definition (will probably be Maven too)
    for the public-facing website.

extlibs/
    Contains a Maven style repository of all libraries required for building
    the Alitheia system.
