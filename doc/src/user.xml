    The Alitheia system is built with independence from user interfaces in mind, so it
    can in theory have any kind of user interface on top of it. Currently, two user
    interfaces, each with a different purpose are existing for Alitheia -- the WebUI, a
    user interface running in a webbrowser and therefore being very easily accessible,
    and the Eclipse plugin, an add-on for the Eclipse IDE that integrates quality
    measurements seamlessly into a development environment. The user interfaces
    exchange data with the Alitheia core through a well-defined web service interface.

        <para>
        The WebUI runs on top of Tomcat. It's implemented as a set of Java beans and JSP
        (Java Server Pages) that display projects that have been evaluated by the Alitheia
        system and their results.
