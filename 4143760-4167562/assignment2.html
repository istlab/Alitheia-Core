<h3>Package Dependency Cycle</h3>

<p>Between the <code>.service.abstractmetric</code> and the <code>.service.metricactivator</code> packages was a cyclic dependency. Also between the <code>.service.abstractmetric</code> and the <code>.service.pa</code> package was a cyclic dependency. These cycles can also be seen in the image below. </p>

<p><img src="img/before.png" width="800px" height="380px" /></p>

<p>To fix these cycles we have merged the <code>.service.abstractmetric</code> and the <code>.service.metricactivator</code> packages and moved <code>PluginAdmin</code> interface and <code>PluginInfo</code> class to the <code>.service.abstractmetric</code> package. The result can be seen in the image below.</p>

<p><img src="img/after.png" width="1020px" height="310px" /></p>

<p>These changes are a good idea, because now the amount of cyclic dependencies is reduced. With is fix we didn't introduce new cyclic dependencies and there are no cyclic dependencies in the <code>.service.abstractmetric</code> package. The package did become larger, but the four files added have a lot to do with the most important class <code>AbstractMetric</code>.</p>
