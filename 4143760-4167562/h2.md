# Problems on the code level
We have looked for duplicated code with [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/). This tool found 313 lines of code (LOC) in a total of 31,760 LOC. Thus only 1% of the Alitheia Core project is duplicate code. The project contains 15,688 LOC with Java, the rest is comments or whitespace. We investigated a few instances of code duplication. One of them is `BugResolution` (lines 121-135) and `BTSEntry` (lines 203-216).

Long Method

SonarQube is also able to calculate the complexicity of the code. The [complexity metrics](http://docs.codehaus.org/display/SONAR/Metrics+-+Complexity) used by SonarQube is count every  `if`, `for`, `while`, `case`, `catch`, `throw` and `return` statement. The `PluginsView` has the highest complexity per function, but also a high amount of code per method.

inCode found nine God classes, two of them scoring a 10 out of 10 m (`GitUpdater` and `ContributionMetrixImpl`). The `GitUpdater` 767 LOC, but another bigger class called `SVNUUpdaterImpl` has 993 LOC.
