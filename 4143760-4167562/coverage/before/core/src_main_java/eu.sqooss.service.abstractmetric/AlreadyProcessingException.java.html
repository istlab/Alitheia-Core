/**
 * Thrown when a DAO is locked for processing by another metric plugin.
 * Metrics cannot lock a DAO object; this happens automatically on
 * entering the metric result calculation code in AbstractMetric to ensure
 * that no two instances of the metric operate on the same DAO (this happens
 * often when a metric starts the calculation of another metric as a result
 * of a metric dependency association). To ensure that a metric transaction
 * actually sees the results of the calculation of the other metric working
 * on the same DAO, this exception is thrown.
